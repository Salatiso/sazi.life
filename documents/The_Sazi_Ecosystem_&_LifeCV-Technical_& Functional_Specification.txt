The Sazi Ecosystem & LifeCV: Technical & Functional Specification
Document ID: ECO-LIFECV-SPEC-V1.0
Date: 2025-07-12
Status: For Implementation
1. The Sazi Ecosystem: A Unified Vision
To create a seamless user experience and unlock the full potential of the interconnected platforms, the entire portfolio will be formally known as the Sazi Ecosystem.
1.1. Ecosystem Name
The Sazi Ecosystem
The name leverages the established sazi.life brand ("sazi" meaning "to know" in isiXhosa) and extends its philosophy of knowledge and empowerment across all platforms.
1.2. Central Hub
The central hub for the ecosystem will be located at: hub.sazi.life
This hub will serve as the primary access point for managing a user's ecosystem-wide profile, settings, and, most importantly, their LifeCV.
1.3. Unified Authentication (Single Sign-On - SSO)
A single authentication system will govern the entire Sazi Ecosystem.
* Functionality: A user can create one account on any platform within the ecosystem (e.g., sazi.life, SafetyHelp, eKhaya) or directly on the hub.sazi.life. These credentials will provide access to all other platforms.
* Technology: The ecosystem will use a central Firebase Authentication instance to manage all user accounts (Email/Password, Google, Apple, etc.), ensuring security and consistency.
2. The LifeCV: Functional Specification
The LifeCV is not a résumé; it is a dynamic, verifiable, and holistic portfolio of a user's competence, contributions, and life experience, aggregated in real-time from across the Sazi Ecosystem.
2.1. Core Purpose
The LifeCV's purpose is to provide a richer, more authentic measure of an individual's capabilities than a traditional CV. It validates practical skills, community involvement, and real-world accomplishments, shifting the focus from "what I've studied" to "what I can do."
2.2. Key Sections & Data Integration
The LifeCV will be a modular dashboard on hub.sazi.life, pulling data from various platforms:

	Description
	Data Source Platforms
	Example Data Points
	Acquired Skills & Knowledge
	Verifiable skills and learning modules completed.
	sazi.life
	- Completed: "OHS Risk Assessment" <br>- Skill: "Basic isiXhosa Conversation" <br>- Badge: "First Dovetail Joint"

	2.3. User Features
* Interactive Dashboard: Users can filter their LifeCV by platform, skill type, or date range.
* Shareable Public Link: Users can generate a unique, public URL to share their LifeCV with potential employers, clients, or collaborators.
* PDF Export: A "Print to PDF" function that generates a professionally formatted, A4 version of the LifeCV, adhering to the ecosystem's document standards.
3. The LifeCV: Technical Specification
3.1. Data Model (Firestore)
The LifeCV will be stored in a life_cvs collection in Firestore. Each document will have the userId as its ID.
// Document in collection: /life_cvs/{userId}
{
 "userId": "firebase_auth_uid",
 "lastUpdated": "timestamp",
 "publicProfileUrl": "hub.sazi.life/cv/unique_hash",
 "entries": [
   {
     "entryId": "unique_id",
     "entryType": "skill" | "portfolio" | "contribution" | "experience" | "credential",
     "title": "OHS Risk Assessment",
     "description": "Completed the advanced module on identifying and mitigating workplace hazards.",
     "date": "timestamp",
     "sourcePlatform": "sazi.life",
     "sourceUrl": "https://sazi.life/courses/ohs-risk-assessment",
     "tags": ["OHS", "Compliance", "Safety"],
     "metadata": {
       "badgeUrl": "/assets/badges/ohs-practitioner.svg"
     }
   },
   {
     "entryId": "unique_id_2",
     "entryType": "portfolio",
     "title": "Generated Safety Plan for ABC Construction",
     "description": "Used the SafetyHelp wizard to create a fully compliant OHS plan.",
     "date": "timestamp",
     "sourcePlatform": "SafetyHelp",
     "sourceUrl": "https://safetyhelp.it/docs/user_doc_id",
     "tags": ["OHS", "Documentation", "Construction"]
   }
   // ... more entries
 ]
}

3.2. API Design
A secure, centralized API will be exposed at api.hub.sazi.life/v1/lifecv.
* Endpoint: POST /entries
* Authentication: The calling platform (e.g., SafetyHelp) must authenticate using a secure, platform-specific API key.
* Request Body:
{
 "userId": "firebase_auth_uid",
 "entry": {
   "entryType": "portfolio",
   "title": "Generated Safety Plan...",
   "description": "...",
   "sourcePlatform": "SafetyHelp",
   "sourceUrl": "...",
   "tags": ["OHS", "Documentation"]
 }
}

* Function: The API will receive the data, validate it, generate a unique entryId, and add it to the entries array in the corresponding user's LifeCV document in Firestore.
4. Minimum Dashboard Requirements for Ecosystem Compatibility
To ensure all current and future platforms can seamlessly integrate with the Sazi Ecosystem and the LifeCV, they must adhere to the following minimum dashboard structure and functionality.
4.1. Standardized Page Structure
Every platform must include the following pages within its user dashboard, accessible after login:
   * index.html (or dashboard root)
   * profile.html
   * settings.html
   * activity.html
   * notifications.html
   * help.html
   * support.html
   * 404.html
4.2. Mandatory Integration Points
   * profile.html: This page must contain a prominent and clearly labeled section or button that links the user to their full LifeCV.
   * Example HTML:
<div class="lifecv-promo">
   <h3>Your Sazi Ecosystem LifeCV</h3>
   <p>Your activities on this platform contribute to your universal LifeCV. View your complete profile to see your aggregated skills and accomplishments.</p>
   <a href="https://hub.sazi.life/cv/{userId}" target="_blank">View My Full LifeCV</a>
</div>

      * settings.html: This page must include a section for managing ecosystem connections.
      * Functionality: Allow users to see the connection status to the Sazi Hub and provide an option to manage data sharing permissions (e.g., "Allow [Platform Name] to add entries to my LifeCV").
This standardized structure ensures a consistent user experience and guarantees that the necessary hooks for LifeCV integration are present across the entire Sazi Ecosystem.
