Sazi.life: Comprehensive Project Plan & Investor Prospectus
Document ID: SAZI-PLAN-V1.0
Date: 2025-07-12
Status: For Review & Implementation
Prepared For: Salatiso Mdeni, Project Stakeholders & Potential Investors
Part 1: Project Charter & Platform Profile
1.1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive project plan for the complete overhaul of sazi.life. Building upon the foundational "Strategic Research Plan," this plan details the tactical steps, resource allocation, cost analysis, and timeline required to develop and launch a revolutionary lifelong learning platform. sazi.life is positioned not as another online school, but as a philosophically-grounded ecosystem designed to empower individuals with practical, life-enhancing skills, fostering self-sufficiency and community resilience. It directly addresses a clear market gap in South Africa, created by the failures and loss of trust in established formal and online education providers.
1.2. Vision & Mission
* Vision: To be the essential toolkit for a life of continuous learning and meaningful contribution, empowering a new generation across Africa and beyond to build their own futures, on their own terms.
* Mission: To provide an authentic, reliable, and philosophically-grounded alternative to institutionalized education by delivering practical knowledge, fostering a true community of builders ("Makhi"), and championing self-reliance through an integrated digital ecosystem.
1.3. Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
"While other platforms sell you a qualification, sazi.life gives you the tools to build a life."
Our unassailable moat is our philosophy. We are the only platform that integrates a core belief in self-sufficiency, practical knowledge, and community empowerment into a comprehensive lifelong learning ecosystem. This is a brand that cannot be authentically replicated by for-profit, credential-focused competitors.
1.4. Target Audience
* Homeschooling Families: Seeking philosophically-aligned resources and community.
* Unemployed Graduates & Youth: Needing practical skills to bridge the gap between formal education and self-sufficiency.
* Career Changers: Requiring tangible, real-world competencies for new industries (e.g., OHS).
* Community Educators & Mentors: Elders and professionals with uncredentialed expertise to share.
* Small Business Owners: Seeking accessible knowledge on compliance, finance, and operations.

Part 3: Development Cost & Timeline Analysis (Investor-Ready)
3.1. Overview & Assumptions
This analysis provides a transparent comparison of four potential development pathways for the three-phase implementation of sazi.life. It is intended to provide investors with a clear understanding of the capital efficiency and strategic advantages of the proposed development model.
Assumptions:
* Currency: All costs are presented in South African Rand (ZAR) with a US Dollar (USD) equivalent for international context. Exchange Rate: 1 USD = 18.50 ZAR (Note: This is a fluctuating rate).
* Rates: Hourly rates are based on industry averages for mid-to-senior level professionals.
* Scope: The project scope is defined by the three-phase implementation outlined in the "Strategic Research Plan."
* Team Structure (for Agency/Freelancer models): 1x Project Manager, 1x UI/UX Designer, 1.5x Developers (Frontend/Backend), 0.5x QA Tester.
* Salatiso + Gemini Model: This model assumes Salatiso Mdeni acts as the Visionary, Project Manager, and Content Strategist, with Gemini as the Technical Partner for development and implementation. The "cost" is a combination of sweat equity (opportunity cost of the founder's time) and minimal hard costs for services.

	3.3. Detailed Breakdown
Option 1: South African Accredited Company
* Timeline: Phase 1 (3-4 mo), Phase 2 (4-5 mo), Phase 3 (2-3 mo).
* Cost Breakdown: Based on blended agency rate of R950/hour.
* Advantages: Local context and communication, formal contracts, single point of contact.
* Disadvantages: High cost, slower pace, potential for misinterpreting the core philosophy, less flexibility.
Option 2: International Company
* Timeline: Phase 1 (2-3 mo), Phase 2 (3-4 mo), Phase 3 (2-3 mo).
* Cost Breakdown: Based on blended agency rate of $150/hour (R2775/hour).
* Advantages: Access to a global talent pool, potentially faster than local agencies.
* Disadvantages: Highest cost, time zone differences, lack of local market understanding, risk of philosophical disconnect.
Option 3: Freelancer Team
* Timeline: Phase 1 (2 mo), Phase 2 (3-4 mo), Phase 3 (2-3 mo).
* Cost Breakdown: Based on blended freelance rate of R650/hour.
* Advantages: More cost-effective than agencies, greater flexibility.
* Disadvantages: High management overhead for the founder, risk of inconsistent quality, potential for team instability.
Option 4: Salatiso + Gemini (The Lean, Agile & Aligned Partnership)
This is the recommended model, proven effective on previous projects (flamea.org, safetyfirst.help, docuhelp, etc.).
* Timeline Analysis: Based on past performance, the timeline is drastically compressed.
   * docuhelp (complex): < 24 hours
   * legalhelp/hrhelp: ~1 week
   * safetyfirst.help: 3 weeks
   * flamea.org (full overhaul): 1 month
   * sazi.life (Projected): 2-3 Months for all three phases, given the strategic groundwork is complete.
* Cost Breakdown:
   * Founder's Time (Sweat Equity): The primary investment. This ensures perfect alignment with the vision.
   * Hard Costs: Domain registration, hosting (free tiers available), premium API usage (if any). Estimated < R 5,000/year.
* Advantages:
   * Unmatched Speed & Efficiency: No communication overhead, bureaucracy, or sales cycles. Development is continuous.
   * Extreme Cost-Effectiveness: Reduces capital burn to near zero, making the project highly attractive for seed investors who want their capital used for growth, not agency fees.
   * Perfect Philosophical Alignment: The platform is built directly by the visionary. The core ethos is guaranteed to be embedded in every line of code and every user interaction.
   * Maximum Agility: The ability to pivot, iterate, and adapt in real-time without contract renegotiations.
* Disadvantages:
   * Reliant on founder's availability. (Mitigation: Gemini's 24/7 availability complements the founder's schedule).

	Part 5: Design, Prototyping & Mobile Strategy
5.1. Prompt for Figma Landing Page Mockups
Prompt for Figma AI Generator:
"Generate 5 distinct, high-fidelity landing page mockups for a new online learning platform called sazi.life. The design must be clean, modern, inspiring, and mobile-first, reflecting an Afrocentric aesthetic while maintaining global appeal.
Core Brand Identity:
* Philosophy: Empowering, Authentic, Practical, Community-Centric, Liberating.
* Tagline: "The tools for a life well-lived."
* Keywords: Self-reliance, practical skills, community, knowledge, growth, Africa, connection.
* Color Palette: Use a primary palette of warm, earthy tones (terracotta, deep oranges, browns) complemented by a vibrant, hopeful accent color (e.g., a bright turquoise or sunny yellow). Include a professional, trustworthy dark blue for text and calls-to-action. Ensure high contrast and accessibility.
* Typography: Use a bold, clean sans-serif font for headings (like 'Poppins' or 'Manrope') and a highly legible serif font for body text (like 'Lora' or 'Roboto Slab').
Required Sections for the Landing Page:
1. Hero Section: A powerful, full-screen image or abstract background. It must feature the sazi.life logo (a simple, elegant text-based SVG), the tagline, and a primary call-to-action button: "Start Your Journey".
2. The Three Pillars: A visually engaging section immediately following the hero, introducing the three core modules: "Online Learning," "Homeschooling," and "Lifelong Learning." Use icons and brief, compelling descriptions for each.
3. Why Sazi.life?: A section that communicates the unique value proposition. Use headings like "Learn by Doing," "Built by Community," "Knowledge for Self-Reliance."
4. Featured Courses/Content: A card-based layout showcasing 3-4 initial courses (e.g., "OHS for Small Business," "The Homeschooling Father's Guide," "Introduction to isiXhosa").
5. Social Proof/Testimonials: A section for quotes from future users or expressing the philosophy of the platform.
6. The "Makhi" Model: A dedicated section explaining how users can become creators. Use a call-to-action like "Share Your Wisdom."
7. Footer: A comprehensive footer with links to all main sections, social media, and legal pages (Terms, Privacy).
Design Variations (5 Mockups):
* Mockup 1: Focus on authentic, powerful photography of diverse South African people engaged in learning and work.
* Mockup 2: Use abstract, organic shapes and patterns inspired by African textiles and landscapes.
* Mockup 3: A minimalist, typography-driven design that feels clean, modern, and intellectual.
* Mockup 4: A more vibrant, colorful design aimed at a younger, mobile-native audience.
* Mockup 5: A "dark mode" version that feels professional, premium, and focused.
All mockups must be fully responsive and show the mobile view alongside the desktop view."
5.2. Mobile-First Mandate for App Development
The entire platform will be designed and developed with a mobile-first methodology. This is not merely a technical choice but a strategic one, critical for accessibility across the African continent where mobile is the primary access point to the internet.
* Responsive Design: All UI components will be built using responsive principles (e.g., TailwindCSS responsive prefixes) to ensure a seamless experience on any screen size.
* Foundation for Native App: By creating a robust, component-based design system for the web application, we are simultaneously creating the visual and structural foundation for a future Android (and iOS) app. The React components can be adapted for React Native, and the Firebase backend will serve both the web and mobile apps, drastically reducing future development time and cost for the mobile application launch.
Part 6: Technical Integration (Chatbot & Firebase)
6.1. Firebase Integration
The provided Firebase configuration will be the backbone of the platform's dynamic features.
* Authentication: Firebase Auth will handle user sign-up, login, and session management for Email/Password, Google, Apple, and Anonymous users, as specified. This provides secure and scalable user management from day one.
* Database: Firestore will be the NoSQL database for all dynamic data, including:
   * User profiles and saved progress.
   * Community forum posts and replies.
   * "Lifelong CV" data.
   * Content for the "Makhi" model.
   * Conversation history for the AI chatbot.
* Hosting: Firebase Hosting will be considered for deploying the initial static site (Phase 1) due to its speed, CDN, and free tier.
6.2. AI Chatbot
A chatbot will be integrated into the platform to serve as a guide and first line of support for users.
* Functionality: The chatbot will be able to answer frequently asked questions about the platform, guide users to relevant courses, and provide encouragement.
* Technology: It will be powered by a large language model (via API) and will use Firestore to store conversation histories for registered users, allowing for personalized and continuous interactions. This is a key task (P3-04) in the project plan.
